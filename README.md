How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by making sure that I write the right codes for the contacts, by making sure that I get all of the errors out of the code, by testing the code files, and by making sure that I zip all of the code files together.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by making sure that I read and listen to what the client needs, by writing the code to meet the client needs to make sure that I get the right output of the client needs, and by testing the code of the client needs to make sure that everything passes, and everything is running good.
How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by writing the code to meet the customer needs, by making sure that I get the right output of the code that the customer needs, by making sure that I test the code so that I know that the code passes to what the customer needs and all of the bugs are out, by zipping all of the files together to make sure the code is more secure, and by using the waterfall model to make sure that I do it one step at a time to get it done.
